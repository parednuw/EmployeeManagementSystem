# EmployeeManagementSystem

Another little project to get to know C++ (and Git) even better.

This project will implement a management system in which information about fictoues employees of a fictous company can be stored.
An entry consists of the name, the date of birth, the department and the job title of one employee. Future extension may be a file-system, for e.g. contracts.

The user of the program is capable of: adding, view, modify and delete an entry - as well as search for specific information. The search can have multiple options which correspond to the categories of an entry.

After implementing the backend, a GUI would be the next step.
